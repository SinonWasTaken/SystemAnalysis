In a world where more people are failing their drivers license test, the Client DriverPass, wishes to help people pass their driving tests, and get their license. They want a system that will allow students to create an account, create a reservation with a trained driver.

I dont think I did anything particurally well, I didn't have much time to put in to this class unfortunately. 

I would redo the first project paper. As stated above, I didn't have much time to dedicate to this class, because of work, and it clearly showed in my grades. Especially in this paper.

The users in this system have very basic needs. They need to be able to create an account, reserve a package, attend their reservation and view any notes given by the driver. The user is the person using the system,so naturally their needs need to be accounted for. If the people who are primarily using the system, cant properly use the system, then the system shouldn't have not been made in the first place.

I've never actually designed a piece of software, but my approach to designing software would cover most of waht is covered in this class. I would first need to determine what the software is supposed to do from the client, and then use a variety of different uml templates to map everything out.
